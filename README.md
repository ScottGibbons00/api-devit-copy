# Lab 5: Platform API

*Sets up a server for blog ost frontend.*

[deployed url](https://platform-api-lab-5.herokuapp.com/)

## What Worked Well
I thought the models, routes and controllers were easy to follow. I liked that we used a different syntax for async await from SA 7. Deployment was not too difficult and now we have a persistent backend and our own server!

## What Didn't
I initially had an issue with my calls just stalling and never returning promises. This was a frusterating issue to debug, but I just restarted the instructions and I forgot to `npm install mongoose`. I did this in SA 7 too!

## Extra Credit

## Screenshots
Same as lab 4! No frontend updates.
